## Notice of deprecation!

As of December 1st 2019 Ribbon has been discontinued after about 2 years of continued support. This decision was made for me to be able to put my full efforts in the joint project to make Skyra ([website](https://skyra.pw/#/)) an even better Discord bot than it already is. Skyra offers all features that Ribbon used to + much much more!

## Features

- **Autogenerated always-up-to-date documentation of all commands available on [My website (has a searchable list)](https://favware.tech/ribbon)**

- Always maintained, always open to squash bugs, and always looking for new features

- Many web searches, such as Google, Google Images, Kitsu, YouTube, Steam and many more

- Looking up data in the PokéDex

- Playing games such as magic 8ball and flipping coins

- Casino chips as currency

- Music streaming from YouTube

- Getting info on members and the current server

- Monitor Twitch streamers and get a message when one goes live

- Auto-moderation functions

- Timed repeating messages

- Support for being self-hosted. Installation instructions [can be found on the wiki](https://github.com/favna/ribbon/wiki/Self-hosting-Installation)

- Many other commands. See [All Commands on the Wiki](https://github.com/favna/ribbon/wiki/All-Commands) for the full list

## Special Thanks

- Many people for the Discord.JS library and Discord.JS-Commando framework

- All the creators of the node packages used in this bot
